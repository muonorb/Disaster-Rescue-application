# RescueLink

RescueLink is a Flutter emergency response application designed to quickly submit emergency SOS requests while offering valuable information and services to rescue agencies. The application allows users to send their location details with a single tap of an SOS button and offers a dedicated dashboard for authorized rescue agencies.

## Key Features

- **SOS Emergency Reporting**: Users can input their phone number and send an emergency SOS request. The app captures the user’s exact coordinates, time, and date, and uploads them to the database as a complaint for immediate action.
  
- **Real-time Weather Data**: The home screen displays current location information including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and visibility fetched via API.

- **Rescue Agency Dashboard**: Agencies can register and log in via an authentication portal. Agencies are approved by a nodal officer who updates their status in the database, making their dashboard accessible.

- **Agency Information Portal**: General information on rescue agencies is listed, such as agency names, locations, and contact details.
